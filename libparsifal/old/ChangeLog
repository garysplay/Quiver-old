Changelog for parsifal
======================

0.8.3, 11.8.2004
    This release introduces many improvements to the parsing algorithms;
    New Trie algorithm based routines speed up DTD tokenizer and improves
    overall performance. Other optimizations have also been done bringing
    parser performance very close to the perfomance of the fastest 
    XML 1.0 parsers available while still retaining lightweight 
    implementation and without compromising XML conformance. Portability 
    has been improved (see News) and of course a few bugs have been fixed:
    - Parser reported inaccurate ErrorLine in some cases where DTD token 
      (name) ended with LF
    - Xmltest VC project files were screwed up because they were 
      accidentally run thru CRLF to LF conversion.

0.8.2, 1.7.2004
    This release fixes some bugs that occurred when parsing deeply nested 
    parameter entities. Also improved tokenizer a bit. These improved 
    some XML 1.0 conformance issues as well.

0.8.1, 13.6.2004
    Two bugfixes:
    - GetSystemID/GetPublicID returned wrong values (and sometimes even 
    garbage). This is now fixed and tested properly.
    - Was unable to parse documents starting with xml-stylesheet PI 
    (w/o xml declaration) Also updated XMLCONF testsuite to current version
    and added some other tricky regression tests that process for example 
    docbook.dtd etc. Examples were also revisited.

0.8.0, 1.6.2004
    This release adds DTD processing support; parameter entities, attribute
    defaulting and DTD declaration events such as elementDeclHandler, 
    attributeDeclHandler etc.  are now available.
    - Added GetCurrentEntity function. see manual
    - Fixed GetSystemID/GetPublicID to return accurate info. see manual
    - Fixed inaccuracy in column position reporting on certain error conditions
    - Fixed bug that make parser try to free invalid pointer when error occurred
    parsing attributes - this lead to crash in some cases.

0.7.5, 23.3.2004
    Dinand Vanvelzen pointed out a bug in XMLStringbuf_Init when parameter
    initSize was 0; _Init was calling malloc with 0 byte allocation request!
    This infact succeeded when m$ RTL was used and same with linux C runtime
    but Borland RTL malloc implementation failed because of this! Also fixed
    some other minor things like XMLNormalizeBuf which now trims the buffer too
    - one could ask why it didn't do this before... ;-)
    Dinand also pointed out an old BYTE #define problem in windows which I've 
    ignored in the past. (win API uses BYTE typedef which conflicts with 
    parsifal definition). Actually I should replace all occurrences of BYTE
    with char but I keep it for bacwards compatibility! Sorry Dinand - putting
    parsifal.h include AFTER windows.h for example works for me. Other option
    is to use:
    #include "libparsifal/parsifal.h"
    #undef BYTE
    #include "windows.h"

0.7.4, 15.2.2004
    Support for linking with GNU libiconv; Now it's possible to parse documents
    in various encodings such as UTF-16, UTF-32, EUC-JP, SHIFT_JIS, 
    ISO-8859-{1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,14,15,16} etc. Internal encoding routines and
    encoding detection has also changed considerably and is now more mature
    implementing XML spec appendix F "Autodetection of Character Encodings".
    
    - Memory corruption bug has been fixed (occurred when attribute
      count grew bigger than 16 or tagstack grew bigger than 16) - added 
      XMLPool routines that make memory handling more sophisticated and safe.
    - Added BIS_ERR_INPUT/XMLP_ERR_IO for easier handling of input source
      callback errors. Input source errors should be distinguished from EOF
      condition expecially when external entities are parsed; entity can appear
      well-formed and ok even when infact there is a stream error when only EOF 
      is checked.
    - Now reports line and column position for all illegal characters too
    - Many other minor fixes and code clean-up

0.7.3, 23.10.2003
    Fixed stupid pointer relocating/reallocation bug in ReadCh()'s CR to LF
    conversion routine. Thanks to Andrew Gray for tracing the bug for me -
    actually I found this bug myself today too not knowing about Andrew... 
    What a scary syncronized world ;)
    Added mingw/dev-cpp (free IDE for mingw) static library project.
    see win32/mingw/dev-cpp/static directory for more info.

0.7.2, 30.9.2003
    Parsing engine has been somewhat rewritten. New parser makes
    more accurate position info and error info possible; see doc for info 
    about XMLParser_GetCurrentColumn etc. Parser is now much more simple
    and there is some performance benefit too.
    API hasn't changed much, only XMLFLAG_CONVERT_EOL got to go. 
    See also APIchanges. 
    Fixed bugs:
    - ISO-8859-1 encoded document with long whitespace section made
      parsing fail because of faulty CRLF conversion routine.

0.7.1, 24.7.2003 
    Fixed bugs:
    - EOL conversion bug when using ISO-8859-1 encoding (was converting
      CRLF to LFLF in some cases).
    - Duplicate attribute checking when XMLFLAG_NAMESPACE_PREFIXES is off
    - Several error condition memory leaks plugged in attribute/namespacedecl 
      containing internal entities.
    - Eliminated some GCC warnings
    
    Also added some new conformance testcases and fixed some sample code.

0.7.0, 3.7.2003 
    Added internal and external general entity support. Optimizations (about 
    50% performance increase). Optimizations in memory management: XMLVector
    improved and optimized. Major code clean up (got rid of stupid and
    confusing LPXMLPARSER object-global temp variables). Major well-formedness
    / XML spec tests and corrections - sources now include OASIS XML testsuite 
    parser. API clean up. See APIChanges for more details. Better samples 
    included. Some C++ tests done too.
    
0.6.8, 10.3.2003
    Various bugs fixed: internal DTD subset parsing bug fixed (
    TOK_END_DTD string ']>' length was 1 in BufferedIStream_Read 3. param!!!). 
    There's still an issue about entity declarations 
    containing ]> in quotes which causes Parsifal to reject document (solving 
    this would require some sort of simple subset validator). See ISSUES.
    Fixed "1 tag document error" bug (this is for all authors of documents
    that contain only  1 element!)
    Bug fixed in BufferedIStream_Peek (assumed memcmp returns 1 or 0 when
    infact it can return < -1 which means false "fatal errors" from
    BufferedIStream_Peek). Thanks to Keijiro Takahashi for pointing this out.
    Added isrcmem.h helper macros and declarations for parsing memory buffers
    (adding more build-in inputsources to Parsifal isn't currently in my TODO 
    list) Also added new sample program xmlcopy (a great piece of s**tware 
    I tell you!)
    
    I've run many more OASIS conformance tests and it seems that Parsifal
    is quite loyal to XML spec at least when it comes to well-formedness. 
    Namespaces seems to be ok too (although there's no "mandatory" 
    http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace uris set for xmlns declarations 
    for example). Still no new test results included in this release.
    Done little benchmarking too. See html docs.

0.6.7, 1.3.2003
    Added Whitespace property; gives more control over how Parsifal
    treats whitespace in element content and in attributes.
    Whitespace handling info also added to Manual.html. 
    Fixed attribute parsing bug: name=XXX'value' 
    where junk in XXX was possible! Strange I never bumped into this 
    until running some OASIS tests...
    Now tests illegal entities like &#1; also and
    reports illegal characters as ERR_XMLP_ILLEGAL_CHAR (new PARSER_ERRCODE) 
    not ERR_XMLP_ENCODING (also reports char value itself inside single
    quotes in ErrorString). Fixed also BUFFEREDISTREAM encoding bug.

0.6.6, 23.2.2003
    Critical bug fix for unicode (UTF-8) validator. Now tested with
    OASIS XML Conformance Subcommittee japanese UTF-8 test files.
    Planning to release "test packs" separately for wfparser -
    current distribution is still including basic well formedness
    tests. Solved some ANSI C header issues as well.

0.6.5, 15.2.2003
    Multi platform release; makefiles for building shared library
    for unix and stuff. Some bug fixes.

0.6.4, 15.11.2002
    Initial release as "xmlproc"
    
    Name changed to "parsifal" 18.11.2002. Thanks for Mr. Lars Marius Garshol 
    who kindly pointed out about the existence of his parser xmlproc! No harm 
    done? (He has an very nice site at http://www.garshol.priv.no which 
    includes for example very thorough info about free XML tools).
