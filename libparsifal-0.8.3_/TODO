TODO for parsifal
-----------------

* Memory allocation could be "heaps better", string interning, smart heap to
  avoid memory fragmentation etc...
* Some profiler runs and optimizations...
* Maybe internal unicode (wchar_t) by conditional compilation? maybe not.
* There's lot of room for improvement in optimization department.
